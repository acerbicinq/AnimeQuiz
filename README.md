Anime Quiz

This quiz is a questionnaire made to determine what kinds of anime would be appropriate for the user.

It was made specifically for newbies who may have been exposed to anime, but never sat down to watch one.
("Anime" is a style of visual content made with, or influenced by, Japanese animation, culture, and storytelling practices.)

//The Quiz: Result//
The end pages are produced based on a scoring range between 100 - 400 points. Wherever the user falls within the range, the end page changes to one of four different result pages.
They can then save after producing a username. The save button will produce the corresponding Watchlist PDF that also matches their score.
