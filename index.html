      <p>Are you someone who has never watched anime before?
        Do you have friends that do, and have been begging you to join in, but they
        haven't suggested anything you found interesting? Or maybe you tried,
       but it seemed too childish or dramatic?</p>
    </div>


<div class="clear">
  <p>Then try out this test. Based on your personality, and what you're in the mood for,
  this quiz will help you find the perfect "gateway" anime to introduce you to the genre.</p>

        <p>Once you finish the test, there will be a chance to download a PDF that lists 5 potential
         shows you'd like, in addition to your initial result.</p>
         <br>
         <p>Hopefully, you'll get hooked! But if not, thanks for giving anime a chance.</p>
